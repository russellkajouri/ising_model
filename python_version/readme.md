## Ising Model

A lattice which consists of N spins in 1 or 2 dimension in which the energy changes is measured by controling the system's temperature in order to minimised energy, Monte Carlo approach assits us to get the minimum energy of the lattice. However, the MC approach lets us to reach the nearest minimum whether is the local or global. Therefore, Metropolis modification seeks to help the MC to get the global minimum energy of the system. Of course, we assume the system has a unique global minimum energy.
